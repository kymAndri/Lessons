			<h2>amber</h2>
			<p>Amber is fossilized tree resin that has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.[1] Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.[2] Amber is used in jewelry and has been used as a healing agent in folk medicine.
				There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions.[3] Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.[4].

			<h2>uranium</h2>
			<p>Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead, and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite.[5].

			<h2>kreptonite</h2>
			<p>Kryptonite is a fictional material that appears primarily in Superman stories published by DC Comics. In its best-known form, it is a green, crystalline material originating from Superman's home world of Krypton that emits a unique, poisonous radiation that can weaken and even kill Kryptonians. Kryptonite radiation can emit through any element except lead. Thus, Superman has a special lead suit to protect himself from the radiation. There are other varieties of kryptonite, such as red and gold kryptonite, which have different but still generally negative effects. Due to Superman's popularity, kryptonite has become a byword for an extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with "Achilles' heel". Batman, Lex Luthor, Metallo, and Titano are four notable characters often presented as using kryptonite â€” the first carrying the substance as a last-ditch method to stop his ally Superman if he is subject to mind control or otherwise compromised, the next two using the mineral to ward off Superman or incorporating it into weapons to try to kill him, and the fourth being able to project rays of kryptonite radiation from his eyes after being altered by simultaneous exposure to kryptonite and uranium.[1]</p>

			<h2>demron</h2>
			<p>Demron is a radiation-shielding fabric. Weight-for-weight the material has slightly lower radiation protection than lead shielding, but it is flexible.[1] The composition of Demron is proprietary information, but it has been described as a non-toxic polyethylene and Non-PVC-based polymer fused between two layers of a woven fabric. The polymer molecule mimics some of the electronic properties of the heavy metals usually used as radiation shielding, and has a large electron cloud so that incoming radiation will deflect or be absorbed by it.[2][3] It is roughly three to four times more expensive than a conventional lead apron, but can be treated like a normal fabric for cleaning, storage and disposal.[4] More recent uses for Demron include certified first responder hazmat suits as well as tactical vests.</p>
